# NVG510Fixer

This is a Xamarin Android application to fix some of the various problems with the U-Verse NVG510 modem. 

You can see more information about it [on my blog.](http://earlz.net/view/2013/08/03/2006/nvg510-fixer-an-android-application)

## Binary Releases

I've archived all of the past releases in the folder `NVG510Fixer\Releases`. 

## Open source

All of this code is now BSD licensed, so it can be incorporated into proprietary closed source software if desired. 

I apologize for the rough organization, this project was initially started as an experiment and thus grew very organically. 
My inexperience with Xamarin Android at the time did not help. 

Unfortunately, I can not easily give the source code to every release. My private git repository contains some optional libraries which are proprietary.

This code does not exactly match the last release. I had to strip out the proprietary libraries and related support code. 
Thus, this code has not actually been tested, but the changes were trivial.
